TWTS Artificial Intelligence

That's What They Said Artificial Intelligence is a project to explore machine learning and artificial intelligence through the use of bad jokes.

## The Outline
1. Amass a list of phrases that should elicit a TWTS response.
1. Amass a list of phrases that should not elicit a TWTS response.
1. Through various means, train the model with that dataset.
1. Test the model by openly listening to conversations (via suitable technology -- no eavesdropping) and allowing for feedback when the response was incorrect (false positive, false negative) or exceptionally good.
1. Try various methods to refine model.
